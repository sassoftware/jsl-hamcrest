## Coding Style Guide

- Functions should start with `ut` and be lower space case. Local variables should
  also be lower space case.
  ```
  ut my function = Function({my arg},
    my local = 5;
    my arg + my local;
  );
  ```
- Matcher class names should start with `Ut`, end with `Matcher` and use CamelCase.
  ```
  Define( "UtMyMatcher", ... );
  ```
- Documentation should be provided for all functions, variables, and classes.
  Below is an example of how to document a function. Only a description is
  required but other parts like prototype, arguments, and examples are 
  encouraged.
  ```
  /*    Function: ut my function
            ---Prototype---
            ut my function( x )
            ---------------
            Some useful, potentially multiple paragraph description.
        
        Arguments:
            x - description of argument x
        
        Example:
            This is an example
            ---JSL---
            x = 5;
            ut my function( 5 );
            ---------
  */
  ut my function({x}, ... );
  ```
## Things to Know

- Some matchers, especially ones that inherit funtionality from base classes
  require injecting a self reference, which is done within the matcher factory.
- Some functions utilize `ut move to anonymous namespace` to prevent variable collisions
